`misfortune` - a small binary exploitation challenge to demonstrate a classic return2libc attack.

You can build the docker image and pull down the binaries with:

```
./setup.sh
```

This will ask for `sudo` permissions just to give your current user permissions to work easily work with the binary and libc file pulled out of the Docker container.
